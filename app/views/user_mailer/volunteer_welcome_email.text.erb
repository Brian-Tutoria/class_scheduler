Welcome to <%= @domain %>, <%= @user.first_name %>
===============================================

You have successfully created a <%= @role %> account on <%= @domain %>. This is the first step in the registration process.

Your username is: <%= @user.email %>. To sign in to the site, just follow this link: https://<%= @url %>. Only do this after your account is activated, per the steps below.

Here are the last steps required to become active on our platform:

1. Screening Interview: To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients and volunteers, we ask that our volunteers undergo a brief screening interview by video. This interview requires no preparation. Feel free to call, text, or email our Volunteer Support Team to schedule. Their contact details are below:

<%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %>
<%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_DISPLAY'] %>

2. Background Check:  As mentioned on our FAQ page, all new volunteers must pass a criminal background check at their expense. As of December 2020, our partner, Sterling Volunteers, charges 12 USD for volunteers based in the United States and 30 USD for non-US volunteers. (Pricing may change, so free to reach out to the Volunteer Support Team for an update.) Our Volunteer Support Team will walk you through the process. After the check, if there are no issues, the team will activate your account. You can then proceed to Step 3 below.

3. Availabilities: Please enter your availabilities so you appear in clients' search results. Once logged in, this can be done from the Availabilities menu option.

Once Step 3 is complete, clients will be able to reach out to you for help.

If you have any questions, check out our FAQ page at https://<%= @domain %>/faq or contact us at volunteer@<%= @domain %>. Thanks for dedicating your time to clients in need!

Yours in service,
